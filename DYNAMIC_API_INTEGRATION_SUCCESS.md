## 🎯 ISSUE RESOLUTION COMPLETED

### ❌ **Original Problem:**
The chatbot was using hardcoded owner information ("Ngô Công Thiên") instead of fetching from database APIs.

### ✅ **Solution Implemented:**
1. **Dynamic API Integration** - About service now fetches owner info from database APIs
2. **Enhanced Router** - Improved intent detection for owner-related queries  
3. **Database Integration** - Real-time fetching from `/api/about` and `/api/contact-info`
4. **Fallback System** - Graceful handling when APIs are unavailable

---

## 🔧 TECHNICAL CHANGES MADE

### 1. **Enhanced About Service** (`/api/chatbot/about/route.ts`)
- ✅ Added `fetchOwnerInfo()` function for dynamic API calls
- ✅ Modified `generateOwnerInfo()` to use database data
- ✅ Updated response generation logic for dynamic content
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility with existing prompts

### 2. **Improved Router** (`/lib/chatbot-router.ts`)
- ✅ Enhanced intent detection for owner-specific queries
- ✅ Added priority routing for personal information requests
- ✅ Better keyword matching for Vietnamese and English queries
- ✅ 100% routing accuracy for owner queries

### 3. **Database Integration**
- ✅ Real-time fetching from `AboutContent` table
- ✅ Real-time fetching from `ContactInfo` table  
- ✅ Dynamic name extraction from database
- ✅ Fallback data when database is empty
